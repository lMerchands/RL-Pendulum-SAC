# Reinforcement Learning with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) in Pendulum-v1

This project implements and compares two reinforcement learning strategies in the Pendulum-v1 environment: a random policy vs. a policy trained using the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. It includes reward tracking, performance analysis, and result visualization.
